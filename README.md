# REINFORCEMENT LEARNING

## Overview

Python implementations of reinforcement and online learning core
concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- __Coursework__: this folder contains the final project. It contains
  the implementation of game agnostic and heuristic based algorithms
  that play the lemonade stand game. The report describing the design
  of the aforementioned implementation can be found in this folder ([HERE](https://github.com/dda410/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Coursework/report/main.pdf)).

- __Lab1__: this folder contains dynamic programming implementations
  applied on Fibonacci sequence and graph shortest path
  computation. It also contains a q-learning implementation used to
  solve the mountain car problem. The report describing the design
  of the aforementioned implementation can be found in this folder ([HERE](https://github.com/dda410/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Lab1/report/main.pdf)).
  
- __Lab2__: this folder contains value function approximation
  implementation exploited to solve the mountain car problem. It also
  contains a radial basis function approximation implementation used
  to solve a linear regression problem. The report describing the design
  of the aforementioned implementation can be found in this folder ([HERE](https://github.com/dda410/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Lab2/report/main.pdf)).

- __Lab3__: this folder contains several online learning algorithms
  implementations to play the capture the flag game (a multi-armed
  bandit type of game). The report describing the design
  of the aforementioned implementation can be found in this folder ([HERE](https://github.com/dda410/ReinforcementLearning/blob/master/Lab3/report/main.pdf)).
