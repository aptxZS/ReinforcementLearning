\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is to develop algorithmic strategies to play
the Lemonade Stand Game (LSG). The LSG is a three agents game with a
12 positions setting, distributed like the hours on a clock.  At every
round, each player chooses a spot to put his stand on, $A_i = {P_1, ...,
  P_{12}}$. Every player chooses at the same time, without knowing the
choice of the other players at the current round since communication
between agents is not allowed. After each round, the utility of a
player is calculated as the sum of the distances between the closest
clockwise player and the closest anticlockwise player. The only
exception to this is when two or all players are sitting on the same
spot. In the first case the two players sitting in the same spot
collect a quarter of the total revenue of a single round while the
third collects half of it. In the second case each agent collects a
third of the total revenue. The total points given at each round depend
on how much points are assigned for a single spot. We use the 
$U_{spot}$ variable to indicate this measure and $R_{total}$ to
indicate the total revenue of a single round. Equation \ref{points} shows
how the total number of points for a round are calculated.
\begin{equation}\label{points}
R_{total} = U_{spot} \times positions \times 2
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{points} multiplies the total number of points that the
spots generate by two since every point is collected by two
agents. Assigning $1$ to the unit spot variable leads to a total
revenue per round of $24$, while assigning $6$ to the spot variable
leads to a $144$ total revenue.
In this paper, we described and evaluate different algorithmic
strategies to play the Lemonade Stand Game.
